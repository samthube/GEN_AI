"I am very happy. LG product quality is good, performance is excellent, and washing is superb. Almost 100% value for money! Diwali purchase at an affordable price with a discount. Very, very happy. The front-load washing machine is the best!"

"The wok is made of the lowest possible grade of carbon steel with underlying rust and seasoned with an industrial-grade vegetable oil. There is indeed a coating on the wok that will eventually wear off, exposing bare metal that will start to rust if not immediately seasoned. Ours had rust hidden under the coating, which eventually chipped by the 10th use.  
Contacted customer support... guess what? Rust and chipping are not covered under warranty."

"At a price of ₹500, we have the option of purchasing a C-type earphone, which I believe is the most affordable option, excluding some low-quality earphones priced at ₹100 or ₹200."

"Hoodie material is very soft, but when you order, please select one or two sizes larger than your usual size. My size is L, but it fits a little tight and short, like an M size."

"I switched to the S23 Ultra from the iPhone 13. For me, the S23 Ultra is in a different league compared to the iPhone 13. The cameras are so much better, and the telephoto lens adds an interesting and useful component. Even when gaming, it gives me 120 fps in most games.  

The display is fantastic, and the charging is adequately fast and reliable (you need to buy the 45W charger separately). Additionally, the speakers are fantastic, and the haptic feedback is great too. The only major downside I found is that it heats a little while playing heavy games, and charging is slow when the phone is in use.  

Overall, if you can get this phone below ₹85k, go for it as it’s almost identical to the S24 Ultra. Battery backup is great, lasting me an entire day with 1.5 charging cycles (my average SOT is 10-14 hours). The S Pen is handy occasionally.  

If you're looking for the best all-rounder Android phone under ₹100k, this is the one to get. It will receive updates till Android 17, so no worries about outdated software. However, note that the phone is huge. If you’re uncomfortable with this size, consider the regular S23 models. If you have the budget and need these features, I 100% recommend this phone."

"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy M32 for a couple of weeks now, and I am really impressed with its performance. The display is super crisp with its 90Hz refresh rate, making everything look smooth. The 6000mAh battery is a beast! It easily lasts me two days with moderate usage, and even with heavy gaming, I don’t feel like I need to charge it frequently. Camera quality is top-notch, especially in daylight. Highly recommend this phone for anyone looking for a budget-friendly option with premium features!"

"Really disappointed with this phone. I bought it based on the reviews, but the experience hasn't been great. The phone overheats even with basic usage like watching videos or browsing the web. The camera quality is poor in low light, and the face unlock feature is quite slow. The build quality feels cheap, and the phone starts lagging when multitasking. I expected much more from Samsung at this price point. Not worth the money!"

"I’ve been using these earbuds for a few weeks now and I'm very satisfied with the overall performance. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. The bass is deep, and the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works decently in blocking out background noise. Battery life is impressive – I get around 20 hours on a full charge, and the case itself is compact and handy. The only downside is that the touch controls are a bit too sensitive, but other than that, great value for money!"
