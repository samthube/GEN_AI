Subject: Project Update and Timeline
Body:
Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the project that we've been working on. As of today, the team has completed 75% of the tasks, and we are on track to finish everything by the end of this month. We’ve encountered some minor challenges, particularly with the design phase, but I’m confident that we'll be able to resolve these issues by next week.

We are expecting to have a draft ready by the 20th, which we will send for your review. Please let me know if you’d like a detailed progress report or if you have any concerns.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,  
John
